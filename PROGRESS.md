# Progress Log

A session-by-session narrative of what's been built, what's in flight, and what's next. Companion to `git log` (which is the underlying audit trail). Updated at the end of every working session.

## Status

**Phase 1 — Schema foundation: migrations 001–008 applied.** Migration 008 patched a bootstrap bug in the role-change trigger that surfaced when promoting the first admin. Ready to move to Phase 2 (Google Sheets service account + ingestion Edge Functions).

## Build order overview

Step 1 of 9 in the roadmap from [PROJECT_BRIEF.md](PROJECT_BRIEF.md):

1. **Supabase setup, migrations, RLS, seed reference data** ← here, complete pending review/apply
2. Google Sheets API service account setup, share each sheet
3. Ingestion Edge Functions — Bank Deposit first, then Customer Support, Customer File, Weekly Sales, Marketing Expense, Realtor Managers Weekly
4. React scaffold — auth, routing, layout shell, global date filter
5. Sales (Land) section — pattern-setting
6. Marketing → Customer Support → Realtor Management sections
7. Media & Content (manual-entry forms for the 4 brands)
8. Rule-based narrative engine, per-section, cached per period
9. Manual refresh button, polish, Netlify deploy

## Completed milestones

- **2026-05-07** — Project bootstrap (commit `f1942d3`):
  - Foundation docs: `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`
  - Scaffold: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind v3 + Recharts + Supabase JS, all installed via pnpm
  - Supabase CLI initialized (`supabase/config.toml`); migrations + functions dirs created
  - Migration 001 (`20260507000001_extensions_and_helpers.sql`): `uuid-ossp`, `pgcrypto`, `pg_trgm` extensions; `set_updated_at()` trigger function; `parse_month_year()` helper for Marketing Expense source-tab anchoring
  - First commit on `main`, attributed to user identity

- **2026-05-10** — GitHub remote attached and pushed; workflow infrastructure locked in (commit `70570f9`):
  - Repo created at `pgoperations/pertinence-dashboard`; remote configured; push succeeded after collaborator-access fix
  - Migration 002 (`20260510000002_reference_tables.sql`) — reference tables + seed: `brands`, `locations` + aliases, `purposes` + aliases, `expense_categories`, `plot_types` (4 canonical seeded), `realtor_managers` (3 seeded), `customer_service_reps` (5 seeded with brand FKs), `complaint_categories` + aliases. RLS enabled, no policies (deferred to migration 006).
  - Workflow infrastructure: `MEMORY.md` baseline (6 files), this `PROGRESS.md`, critique-workflow integration plan all in place
  - `pgoperations` org → `shawnumo` collaborator path resolved the push 403

- **2026-05-10** — Schema phase end-to-end (migrations 003–007 written this session):
  - Migration 003 (`20260510000003_auth.sql`) — auth: `user_role` enum (admin/editor/viewer), `profiles` table (1:1 with `auth.users`), `handle_new_user` signup trigger, `prevent_role_self_change` BEFORE UPDATE trigger (catches what RLS WITH CHECK can't enforce), helpers `current_user_role()` / `is_admin()` / `is_editor_or_admin()` (SECURITY DEFINER + STABLE + pinned `search_path`), and profile RLS policies
  - Migration 004 (`20260510000004_fact_tables.sql`) — six fact tables: `marketing_expenses`, `bank_deposits`, `weekly_sales`, `customer_files`, `customer_support_logs`, `realtor_manager_weekly`. Common idempotency contract `(source_sheet, source_tab, source_row_id)` unique + `raw_row` jsonb + `quality_flags` jsonb. Foreign keys to reference tables `on delete set null` so canonical changes don't destroy facts.
  - Migration 005 (`20260510000005_aggregates.sql`) — minimum-viable aggregate set: `marketing_monthly`, `customer_support_monthly` (period × brand), `sales_by_location_monthly` (with the partial-index trick to keep the null-location bucket unique per period). More aggregates land per-panel during step 5+.
  - Migration 006 (`20260510000006_rls_policies.sql`) — RLS for reference / fact / aggregate: all `to authenticated`, anon role gets nothing. Reference tables admin-managed; fact + aggregate writes service-role-only.
  - Migration 007 (`20260510000007_dashboard_infra.sql`) — `data_quality_alerts` (editors + admins resolve), `narrative_cache` (service-role writes only, with `generator_version` for cache invalidation), `social_media_manual_entries` (editors + admins write, admins delete).
  - `supabase/functions/_shared/quality_flags.ts` — exported flag vocabulary (`unknown_location`, `unknown_purpose`, `fallback_category`, `missing_realtor`, `low_match_confidence`, `unparseable_plot_type`, `unparseable_date`, `null_sales_person`)

- **2026-05-10** — Phase 1 complete. Migrations 001–008 applied to live Supabase project (`hrmrqpkcvyjwxrehrgvq`) via the dashboard SQL editor. First-admin promotion exposed a bootstrap bug: the `prevent_role_self_change` trigger in migration 003 blocked the very first role assignment because `is_admin()` returns false when no admin exists yet (and `auth.uid()` is null in the SQL editor's postgres-role context). Fixed in migration 008 by short-circuiting the trigger when `auth.uid() is null` — that's only ever true for trusted server-side contexts since anon clients are filtered by the existing profiles RLS policies before the trigger runs. Smoke test passed: test user signed up via dashboard → `handle_new_user` trigger created profile row with `role='viewer'` → promotion to admin succeeded after 008. Public signup disabled in dashboard (Auth → Sign In / Up).

## Current focus

**Phase 2: Google Cloud project + service account for Sheets API access.**

Next session entry points:
1. Create Google Cloud project (or reuse an existing one) and enable the Google Sheets API
2. Create a service account, download its JSON key, store the email + key safely (likely as Supabase Edge Function secrets)
3. Share each of the four source sheets (Marketing Fund Expense, Bank Deposit Mirror, Customer Support Master, Marketing Team Reporting Template) with the service account email as Viewer
4. Smoke-test access: a tiny `pnpm` script that reads one tab via the service-account creds, just to confirm the auth path works before any Edge Function code is written
5. Then Phase 3: Bank Deposit ingest Edge Function (cleanest source, most important — the financial source of truth)

## Next checkpoint

Service account provisioned, all four source sheets shared, read-access smoke test green. After that we move into Edge Function code for the first ingest (Bank Deposit).

## Open items waiting on supervisor

From [PROJECT_BRIEF.md](PROJECT_BRIEF.md) "Open items still needing supervisor confirmation":

- [ ] Confirm `DATE.1` (column K) on `2026 LAND` is the real transaction date (default `DATE` defaults to month-start)
- [ ] Approval for the canonical location/purpose mappings (the supervisor needs to review the draft before `locations` / `purposes` ref tables get seeded — that's why migration 002 ships those tables empty)
- [ ] Marketing Expense `Category` dropdown column added to source sheet (until then, ingest falls back to keyword-based auto-categorization with `fallback_category` quality flag)
- [ ] 2026 tab created in Marketing Team Reporting Template — Realtor Managers Weekly Report
- [ ] Confirm Customer Support panel default brand filter (currently planned: PPL, mirroring H1 PDF; toggle to RealVest or "all")

## Open items waiting on Shawn

- [ ] Pick / create the Google Cloud project that will own the Sheets-API service account (Phase 2 kickoff).
- [ ] Decide where the service-account JSON key lives — likely as Supabase Edge Function secrets (`SHEETS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`, `SHEETS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY`); confirm before provisioning.
- [ ] Clean up the test user (`delete from auth.users where email = '<test email>';` — cascade-deletes the profile row) once Phase 2 starts, so the only remaining account is your real admin.
